I am a quantitative ecosystem ecologist. My research spans multiple subfields of ecology but shares a unified theme of linking empirical patterns to the processes generating them. I strive to search for universalities in ecology. I also have a keen interest in statistics and its application in ecology.</p>

<p>I am currently a postdoctoral research associate with James Bence and Scott Peacor at Michigan State University.

I also write a <a href="http://songchao1986.wordpress.com">blog</a> to share my experiences in research.
