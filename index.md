I am a quantitative ecosystem ecologist. My research focuses on understanding ecosystem processes under changing environments. I employ both experimental and modeling approaches in my research. I also have a keen interest in statistics and its application in ecology.</p>

I am currently a professor in the College of Ecology at Lanzhou University.
